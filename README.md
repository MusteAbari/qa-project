# Brief
My objective for this project was to create an application that exercises CRUD (Create Read Update and Delete) functionalities whilst making use of the technologies and the training I've learnt in the past six weeks.

The requirements are as followed:
	• A project tracking software (Trello Board)
	• A Relational database used to store data persistently for the project(2 or more tables)
	• Clear Documentation of my design phase that describes the architecture that'll be used for the project and also a detailed Risk assessment
	• A functioning front-end web application that 
	• A functioning CRUD application that has been created by python using 

To achieve this I decided to create a car reviews app, where users can put up their vehicle and the public can see the cars and review them:

I started by creating a Cars table where users will be able to store details of their vehicles, this table will contain 
	
	• Car_id
	• Reg
	• Make
	• Model
	• millage 
	• Colour
	• Age

My second table will be the Reviews table which will store the reviews on a car, this table will contain 
	
	•Reviews_id
	• Name
	• Review
	• Rating
	• Review Date
	• Car_ID

By allowing car owners to add cars to the DB that will be me showing 'Create' from the CRUD specification

By allowing users to view cars that the owners have put up, then I will be able to justify the 'Read' aspect of CRUD.
By allowing car owners to edit the details of their cars and by giving them the ability to delete a car, I will be able to justify the 'Update' and 'Delete' in CRUD.
